Game Description



This game is a strategy tycoon simulator where the player manages construction, resources, and production efficiency to grow their empire.



Players can construct various types of buildings, each serving a unique purpose:



Offices generate money over time and can be built for free.



Factories produce different resources depending on their type.



Building construction requires money, except for offices which are always free.



The playerâ€™s level increases as they accumulate wealth. For example:



Level 2 is reached at 100,000 money,



Level 3 at 1,000,000 money, and so on.



Higher levels directly boost building efficiency, meaning the more you progress, the faster your economy grows.



A blueprint-based crafting system allows players to create specific products by selecting available blueprints and consuming the required resources.



The game includes a save system:



Automatic saves occur every minute.



Manual saves are available at any time via the Save button.



From the main menu, players can also configure graphics settings, choosing from different quality presets (High, Medium, Low) for the best gameplay experience.
